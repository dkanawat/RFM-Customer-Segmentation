# 📊 RFM Customer Segmentation

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. It helps identify loyal, high-spending, and at-risk customers to support targeted marketing and improve business performance.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Summary

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**  
   Gathered transactional data including customer ID, order date, and spend. Cleaned and prepared the data for accurate calculation of RFM metrics.

2. **Calculating RFM Metrics**  
   Computed Recency (days since last purchase), Frequency (purchase count), and Monetary (total spend) for each customer to evaluate engagement.

3. **Scoring and Segmentation**  
   Assigned scores (1–5) for each RFM metric, then grouped customers into segments like champions, potential loyalists, and at-risk using combined scores.

4. **Visualization and Reporting**  
   Created an interactive HTML report with visualizations and tables to explore segment characteristics and support marketing decisions.
